# deepfake-detection-by-deep-learning
this is a deep learning model for deepfake detection
## data source: DFDC from kaggle
The DFDC dataset includes 119,197 videos, each 10 seconds long, with frame rates ranging from 15 to 30fps and resolutions ranging from 320x240 to 3840x2160. 
19,197 of the training videos were real footage shot by about 430 actors, and the remaining 100,000 were fake face videos generated from real videos. 
DeepFakes, Face2Face and other mainstream algorithms were used to generate fake faces, making the dataset contain as many fake face videos as possible.
